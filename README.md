# Parts of Speech

## Nouns
A word (other than a pronoun) used to identify any of a class of people, places, or things common noun, or to name a particular one of these proper noun.

## Pronouns
A word that can function by itself as a noun phrase and that refers either to the participants in the discourse (e.g., I, you ) or to someone or something mentioned elsewhere in the discourse (e.g., she, it, this ).

#### Kinds of pronouns:
* Personal pronouns
  * Personal pronouns always represent: 
    * a very specific person
    * group of people
    * object
  * The thing represented by a personal pronoun is called the antecedent. 
  * Forms:
    * Subjective:
      * I, he, she, they 
      * Used as the subjects of verbs
    * Objective:
      * Me, him, her, them
      * Used as 
        * Direct and direct objects
        * Objects of prepositional phrases
        * Subjects of infinitives
* Demonstrative verbs
  * this, that, these, those
  * Also require an antecedent
* Relative and Interrogative 
  * who, whom, whose, what, which, that
  * Begin noun-modifying clauses:
    * *The hand* that signed the paper...
* Indefinite
  * Everyone, everybody, no one, nobody, someone, etc..
  * Represent ambiguous or not clearly defined objects
  * Always singular:
    * every, everyone, everybody, no one, nobody, someone, one, nothing, everything..
  * Always Plural: 
    * both, many, several, few, fewer, others
  * Can be singular or plural:
    * none, all, some, any, most, more
    * Look for a noun modified or an "of" preposition
      * some soccer players
      * Most of the X are Y, but some are Z.

#### Pronoun Agreement 
* Collective nouns
  * Pronouns and their verbs must match
  * Some pronouns sound plural, but are singular and should take a singular verb 
* Ambiguous antecedents 
  * Pronouns must be explicit as to what they refer to, even if the meaning is implied
* Possessive
  * Under most conditions, the antecedent of a pronoun should not be in the possessive. 
  * If a noun appears in the possessive, it must be repeated as a noun in another grammatical use. 
    * Caesar's victories in Gaul significantly expanded the size of the Roman Republic, and triumphs over the legendarily fierce Celtic people to the north gave **him** a luster of heroism to the Roman people.
    * Caesar's victories in Gaul significantly expanded the size of the Roman Republic, and triumphs over the legendarily fierce Celtic people to the north gave **Caesar** a luster of heroism to the Roman people.
  * Exception: a noun in the possessive, can be the antecedent of a possessive pronoun.
    * Caesar's triumphs in Gaul significantly enhanced his reputation at home. 

## Subject 
A noun phrase functioning as one of the main components of a clause, being the element about which the rest of the clause is predicated.

## Adjectives
A word or phrase naming an attribute, added to or grammatically related to a noun to modify or describe it.

## Determiners
A modifying word that determines the kind of reference a noun or noun group has, for example a, the, every.

## Verbs
A word used to describe an action, state, or occurrence, and forming the main part of the predicate of a sentence (e.g., run, jump, dance).

Every sentence must have at least one verb.

### Transitive vs. Intransitive: 
* Transitive verbs take a direct object
  * To buy, to steal, to take
* Intransitive verbs do not take a direct object
  * Often are states of being
  * Have no effect on an external object
    * To laugh
    * To be
    * To prosper
   
### Verb forms

#### Infinitive
* The form of a verb that follows "to":
  * To buy a house
  * To sell a car
  * To jump
* Infinitives have three uses:
  * To be the subject of a sentence
    * **To err** is human; **to forgive**, divine.
    * An infinitive or infinitive phrase can have its own subject.
      * The subject follows the preposition "for":
        * ** For me to tell her about the affair** would create a most awkward situation.
  * To be an "infinitive of purpose"
  * To be the direct object, by idiom, of certain verbs

#### Moods 
* Imperative (commands):
   * Won't be tested on the GMAT
   * Example: Say! Say it out loud!  
* Indicative (factual):
  * Indicates a factual statement. 
    * He says, said, will say
* Subjunctive (hypothetical):
  * Used for wishes, hopes, and hypothetical situations.
  * Just the infinitive form of the verb. There is no verb number.
    * ... that I sell my car.
    * ... that Henry by a house. *(not buys)*
    * ... that he be quiet.
  * Used after **lest** and after **that** clauses conveying commands and wishes:
    * ... ask that ...
    * ... demand that ...
    * It is crucial that ...
  * Past subjunctive is only used with the word "were":
    * If I were you...
    * If this were the seventeenth century   

#### Tenses
* Simple: 
* Progressive:
  * Formed by: [correct tense form of the verb "to be"] + [present participle]
  * Indicates an ongoing process or the simultaneity of actions
  * Examples:
    * He *has been working* on a project for the past year.
    * When you called, I *was taking* a bath. 
  * Tips:
    * Use the present progressive only when necessary
    * Don't use the present progressive to discuss the future:
       * Tomorrow, he ~~is departing~~ for Laos.
      * Tomorrow, he will depart for Laos.
    * Don't use the present progressive for definitions and static facts
    * The past progressive can be used to put a past action behind another
      * The baby *was crying* when his father walked through the door
      * The baby *cried* when his father walked through the door.
* Perfect:
   * Perfect = Fully completed or fully done
   * Three tenses: Past, Present, Future
   * Past perfect:
     * Formed by: "had" + [past participle]
       * I had walked
       * He had bought
       * They had sold
     * Used to indicate an event before another past event
       * Simple: He *wrote* his manifesto when the President imposed martial law.
       * Past perfect: He *had written* his manifesto when the President imposed martial law. 
       * CAUTION: If the sentence was the following, then using the past perfect could be **redundant**, as **before** already explicitly states the action happened before the other. 
         * He *had written* his manifesto **before** the President imposed martial aw. 
   * Present perfect (rare on the GMAT): 
     * Formed by: "has / have" + [past participle]
       * I have walked
       * He has bought
       * They have sold
     * Used to indicate an event that started in the past and continued up until the resent moment.
   * Future perfect: 
     * Formed by "will have" + [past participle]
       * I will have walked
       * He will have bought
       * They will have sold
     * Used to indicate a future event that will be completed by the time of something else in the future.
       * By next Spring, when Thalia graduates, Matt will have joined an MBA program. 
* Perfect Progressive: 
  * Present perfect progressive:
    * Formed by: "has/have been" + [present participle] 
    * Carries the connotation of an action that started in the past and is ongoing to the present moment.
      * I have been reading.
  * Past perfect progressive:
    * Formed by: "had been" + [present participle] 
  * Present perfect progressive:
    * Formed by: "will have been" + [present participle] 

#### Sequence of Tense rules:
* When a someone in the **past** reported (spoke, or thought, argued, believed, etc) on events in their past, their present, and their future: 
  * Speaker's past = past perfect
  * Speaker's present = simple past
  * Speaker's future: conditional (would)
    * Ex: Geologist Charles Lyell believed that the theologians of previous centuries **had** vastly **underestimated** the age of the Earth and that evidence **would justify** a much older Earth then was previously suspected. 

#### Voice
* Active
  * [Do-er] [active verb / action] [direct object]
    * He bought the house.
  * Intransitive verbs are only active
  * GMAT prefers active voice
* Passive 
  * [Direct object] [passive verb] "by" [do-er]
    * The house was bought by him. 
  * Formed by: form of the verb "to be" = [past participle]
    * He is seen.
    * He was seen.
  * Both transitive and intransitive verbs can have passive voice
  * The passive voice **is** grammatically correct. 
  * The passive voice is acceptable if the identity of the "do-er" is unknown. 
    * Overnight, the storefront was vandalized. 
  * For rhetorical reasons, we may want to focus on the recipient of action.
    * Passive: The photoelectric effect, the basic principle of solar cells, having tremendous implications in the unfolding of quantum theory, was explained by Einstein in 1905. 
    * Active: In 1905, Einstein explained the photoelectric effect, the basic principle of solar cells, having tremendous implications in the unfolding of quantum theory, hmm. 
    * Focus of the sentence is the photoelectric effect. Passive might be preferred here.

  * Singular
  * Plural 	

#### Auxillary verbs 
* A verb used in forming the tenses, moods, and voices of other verbs.

## Participles
A word formed from a verb (e.g., going, gone, being, been) and used as an adjective (e.g., working woman, burned toast) or a noun (e.g., good breeding).

* Participles and participial phrases can:
  * be placed in front of nouns to act as modifiers.

    * As a participle, a modifier
      * The couple *buying the house across* the street has two dogs.
    * As a gerund, in a noun role
      * *Buying a new house* is a very time consuming task.
* Past:

#### Participial phrase
* Formed by: [participle] + [predicate]

    * Yesterday, I saw a man riding a unicycle.
    * Right now, I see a man riding a unicycle.
    * Tomorrow, I will see a man riding a unicycle.
* If the action in the modifier happens at a different time from the action of the main clause, we cannot use a participle phrase
* **When the action of the sentence and the action of the object happen at two different times, we need two different clauses**
  * Right now, I ~~see the man yesterday~~ riding a unicycle.
  * Right now, I see the man who yesterday was riding a unicycle.

## Construction
#### Subject verb agreement 
* Compound Subjects:
  * Two singular nouns joined by "and" or make a compound subject take a plural verb
  * A noun and an additive phrase take a singular verb
   * Additive phrases:
    * P, as well as Q,
    * P, including Q,
    * P, in addition to Q,
   * Example: The mayor, as well as the deputy mayor, **approves** of the legislation. (Mayor is the only subject)
  * Subjects in P or Q format:
   * Verb takes the number of the second noun
    * The senators or the President is going to issue a statement.
    * The President or the senators are going to issue a statement. 
* Collective nouns
 * Singular nouns that represent a logical group of people take a singular verb

 * To err **is** human
 * For Bob and Jim *to fight* over Sally **was** petty.
* Auxillary Verbs
  * In a series of auxiliary verbs plus main verb, only the first verb in the series can show the verb-number. 
  * Most auxillary verbs don't change for verb number
    * The only ones that change are:
      * has/have
      * do/does
      * is/are
      * was/were

##### Comparisons 
* Comparisons must be like to like

    * Could mean: I like cars more than I like Matt 

#### Infinitive of Purpose
* Consider the following:
  * I will go to the store to buy cookies
  * I will go to the store for buying cookies
* Always use an infinitive of purpose, not a for + [gerund]
* This is a rule, not an idiom
* Variations:
  * A did X to do Y
  * A did X in order to do Y
  * A did X so as to do Y 


#### Parallelism  
#TODO

#### Modifiers
Vital and Non-Vital Noun Modifiers:
* Vital modifiers add critical meaning to the sentence
  * Ex: Cars *that are made in America* cost less than $100k.
    * If you remove the modifier: "Cars cost less than $100k". It changes the entire meaning! 
    * Vital modifiers are not usually set off by commas. 
  * Vital noun modifiers must touch the modified noun even if that means they come between the noun and a non-vital modifier. 
* Non-vital modifiers add additional information, but don't change the meaning if they are removed
  * Ex: Cars, which were first built in America, are a part of every day life for billions of people.
  * Non-vital modifiers are usually set off by commas (and therefore will use a "which" clause) 
* A "that" clause will follow the noun it modifies **without a comma**.
* A "which" clause will follow the noun it modifies **set off by commas**.

Touch rule exceptions 
* Vital noun modifiers must touch the modified noun even if that means they come between the noun and a non-vital modifier. 
  * Henry II *of England*, who was married to Eleanor of Aquitaine, brought Ireland under the subjection of the English crown.
    * Vital noun modifier: of England
    * Non-vital noun modifier: who was married to Eleanor of Aquitaine
* Appositive phrases can come between a noun and it's modifiers
  * Donald Trump, the 45th President of the United States, was unfit to serve.
* A short predicate or short phrase may come between a noun and its modifier. 
  * Today, the former mayor was arrested, who diverted thousands of dollars of public money into his private bank account.

Adverbs & Adjectives
  * Certain adverbs, will change the meaning of the sentence significantly when they are placed in different positions.  
  * Some of them:  
    * Only  
    * Almost  
    * Even  
    * Just  
    * Nearly
  * Ex: 
    1. Before the GMAT, John only studied for six days
    2. Before the GMAT, John studied for only six days
    3. Before the GMAT, John studied for six days only
  * 1 is incorrect, but only modifies John.

##### Because of vs Due to 
Because of:

Due to:
  * Can appear 
    * as an adjective after the verb "to be"
    * as a noun modifier. (see noun modifiers)
